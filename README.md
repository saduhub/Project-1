# SongSensei

## Description

SongSensei is an website that allows a user to keep up with the best artists. Curated by the SongSensei team, a list of artists is posted on the website and users can access information about them as well as their top videos on youtube. SongSensei keeps a history of selected artists so that users can keep their favorite artists pinned in the navigation bar. 

For the time being, it is a website meant to be updated by the SongSensei team. Future updates include: lists curated to individual users, artist categories, playlists, access to indie artists, randomly generated lists of up and coming artists, and much more!  

The motivation behind this project was to allow the SongSensei team to practice collaboration using GitHub, GitHub Projects, and Slack. The team was to was to build a weather-app from the provided code using our collective knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS, server-side APIs, version control, and Tailwind css. Additionaly, this challenge introduced us to concepts regarding API requests, authorization, security, and parsing documentation. Using the YouTube and Wikipedia API's, jQuery were also crucial for completing this project.
